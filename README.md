# PuckMan - A Classic Pack Man Game

PuckMan or Pac-Man is a classic arcade game that was first released in 1980. In the game, the player controls a character named Pac-Man, who must navigate a maze filled with dots while avoiding four colored ghosts. The player must collect all the dots in the maze to progress to the next level.

If Pac-Man comes into contact with a ghost, he loses a life. However, the player can collect power pellets that temporarily allow Pac-Man to eat the ghosts. The game has a total of 256 levels, but the gameplay becomes increasingly challenging as the player progresses through the levels. The goal is to achieve the highest score possible by collecting dots, fruit, and power pellets while avoiding the ghosts.
